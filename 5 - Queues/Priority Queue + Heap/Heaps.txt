Heap is a semi ordered tree, generally Binary

Max Heap - Each parents key is greater than children
Min Heap - Each parents key is smaller than children

HEAP IS IMPLEMENTED VIA PriorityQueue CLASS IN JAVA

Heap Perations:

1) Insert - Always insert an element in the highest, then the leftmost position available.
This is to enable us to use arrays to depict heaps. We then call function "heapify", to bring 
tree back to state that it satisfies property.

2) Removal - We take element out of tree, and then replace it with lowest, then right-most, element
of the tree. Often, we will be removing top most element in PriorityQueue. Then we call Heapify function

Key Differences
The priority queue is working on the queue and the heap is working on the tree data structure.
The priority queue is stored array value in a simple form while the heap is stored array value in a sorted form.
The heap provides multiple functions and operations than the priority queue. The priority queue provides queue-related functions.
The heap implements abstract data types such as priority queue but priority queue does not implement heap.
The priority queue is simpler than the heap data structure. the heap is complicated because of the parent node rule.
Conclusion
The priority queue data structure and heap data structure create, operate, and organizes the array data.
The priority queue and heap works on the highest and lowest priority of the array value.
The priority queue and heap maintains large scale, complicated data of the application easily.
