/*
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. To learn more about Minimum Spanning Tree, refer to this article.
Introduction to Kruskal’s Algorithm:
Here we will discuss Kruskal’s algorithm to find the MST of a given weighted graph. 
In Kruskal’s algorithm, sort all edges of the given graph in increasing order. Then it keeps on adding new edges and nodes in the MST if the newly added edge does not form a cycle. It picks the minimum weighted edge at first at the maximum weighted edge at last. Thus we can say that it makes a locally optimal choice in each step in order to find the optimal solution. Hence this is a Greedy Algorithm.

How to find MST using Kruskal’s algorithm?
Below are the steps for finding MST using Kruskal’s algorithm:
Step 1: Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight. 
Step 2: Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If the cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it. 
Step 3: Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.

Advantages:
Kruskal's algorithm is guaranteed to find the MST in a connected, weighted graph.
It is a relatively simple algorithm to understand and implement compared to some other MST algorithms.

Disadvantages:
Like Kruskal’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm can be slow on dense graphs with many edges, as it requires iterating over all edges at least once.
Prim’s algorithm relies on a priority queue, which can take up extra memory and slow down the algorithm on very large graphs.
The choice of starting node can affect the MST output, which may not be desirable in some applications.

 * Time Complexity: O(E * logE) or O(E * logV)
 * 
 * Sorting of edges takes O(E * logE) time.
 * After sorting, we iterate through all edges and apply the find-union
 * algorithm. The find and union operations can take at most O(logV) time.
 * So overall complexity is O(E * logE + E * logV) time.
 * The value of E can be at most O(V2), so O(logV) and O(logE) are the same.
 * Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(E * logE) or O(E*logV)
 * Auxiliary Space: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the
 * number of edges in the graph.
