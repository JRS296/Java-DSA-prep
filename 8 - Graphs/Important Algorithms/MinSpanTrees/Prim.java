Introduction to Prim’s algorithm:
We have discussed Kruskal’s algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree. Like Kruskal’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm is also a Greedy algorithm. This algorithm always starts with a single node and moves through several adjacent nodes, in order to explore all of the connected edges along the way.
 */

/*
How does Prim’s Algorithm Work? 
The working of Prim’s algorithm can be described by using the following steps:
Step 1: Determine an arbitrary vertex as the starting vertex of the MST.
Step 2: Follow steps 3 to 5 till there are vertices that are not included in the MST (known as fringe vertex).
Step 3: Find edges connecting any tree vertex with the fringe vertices.
Step 4: Find the minimum among these edges.
Step 5: Add the chosen edge to the MST if it does not form any cycle.
Step 6: Return the MST and exit
 */

/*
How to implement Prim’s Algorithm?
Follow the given steps to utilize the Prim’s Algorithm mentioned above for finding MST of a graph:

Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST. 
Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE. Assign the key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first. 
While mstSet doesn’t include all vertices 
Pick a vertex u that is not there in mstSet and has a minimum key value. 
Include u in the mstSet. 
Update the key value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. 
For every adjacent vertex v, if the weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, update the key value as the weight of u-v.
The idea of using key values is to pick the minimum weight edge from the cut. The key values are used only for vertices that are not yet included in MST, the key value for these vertices indicates the minimum weight edges connecting them to the set of vertices included in MST.
 */

/*
Advantages:
Prim’s algorithm is guaranteed to find the MST in a connected, weighted graph.
It has a time complexity of O(E log V) using a binary heap or Fibonacci heap, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.
It is a relatively simple algorithm to understand and implement compared to some other MST algorithms.

Disadvantages:
Like Kruskal’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm can be slow on dense graphs with many edges, as it requires iterating over all edges at least once.
Prim’s algorithm relies on a priority queue, which can take up extra memory and slow down the algorithm on very large graphs.
The choice of starting node can affect the MST output, which may not be desirable in some applications.
