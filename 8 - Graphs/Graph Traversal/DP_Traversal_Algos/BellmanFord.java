/*
The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single 
source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.[1] It is slower than
 Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of 
 handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers. The algorithm 
 was first proposed by Alfonso Shimbel (1955), but is instead named after Richard Bellman
  and Lester Ford Jr., who published it in 1958 and 1956, respectively.[2] Edward F. Moore
   also published a variation of the algorithm in 1959, and for this reason it is also sometimes
    called the Bellman–Ford–Moore algorithm.

Negative edge weights are found in various applications of graphs, hence the usefulness of this
 algorithm.[3] If a graph contains a "negative cycle" (i.e. a cycle whose edges sum to a 
 negative value) that is reachable from the source, then there is no cheapest path: any path 
 that has a point on the negative cycle can be made cheaper by one more walk around the negative 
 cycle. In such a case, the Bellman–Ford algorithm can detect and report the negative cycle.

/*
We have discussed Dijkstra’s algorithm for this problem. Dijkstra’s algorithm is a Greedy algorithm and the time complexity is O((V+E)LogV) (with the use of the Fibonacci heap). Dijkstra doesn’t work for Graphs with negative weights, Bellman-Ford works for such graphs. Bellman-Ford is also simpler than Dijkstra and suites well for distributed systems. But time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(V * E), which is more than Dijkstra.
